        Bachelor Thesis Topic: Development of Obstacle Avoidance Algorithms in Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithms for Target Search Multi-Robot System.

        How the system work: Robots is locate in a search area. Then the robots move to search for a targets.
        With Particle Swarm Optimization, robots is sharing their best location related to possible target location, so robots can find the best possible target location.
        In this simulation, I used 5 robots, and 1 targets.
        Robots use obstacle avoidance so they don't collide with each other and don't collide with obstacles.
        The system is simulate in Matlab.

        This is my friend thesis. I help her to implement the algorithm.

        How the system work:
        Robots is locate in a search area.
        Then the robots move to search for a targets.
        With Niching Particle Swarm Optimization, robots is sharing their best location related to possible target location, so robots can find the best possible target location.
        In this simulation, we used 40 robots, and 4 targets.

        The system is simulate in Webots Simulator using C language.
        I use Matlab just only use to learn about the Niching Particle Swarm Optimization because it's easy to write the code in Matlab and easy to visualize the result.

        Example application of this system is: search and rescue for disaster victims in a dangerous areas
