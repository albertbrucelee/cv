summary:
    title: Summary
    summary: |
        Previously Albert is an Android programmer.
        Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is just starting to develop in Indonesia and still rare.
        So Albert now focuses on AI / ML because he wants to contribute to the development of AI in his beloved country.
        He have experience working on projects with a different title that he had no experience before.
        Therefore he believes, with hard work he will be able to master AI / ML field.
        Last but not least, his dream is to develop Agriculture in Indonesia with AI technology because nowadays many people don't like to work in Agriculture field so it's starting to be abandoned.

        Undergraduate Thesis: Development of Obstacle Avoidance Algorithms in Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithms for Target Search Multi-Robot System.

        How the system work: Robots is locate in a search area. Then the robots move to search for a targets.
        With Particle Swarm Optimization, robots is sharing their best location related to possible target location, so robots can find the best possible target location.
        In this simulation, I used 5 robots, and 1 targets.
        Robots use obstacle avoidance so they don't collide with each other and don't collide with obstacles.
        The system is developed and simulated using Matlab.

        I help my friend to implement the algorithm in her thesis.

        Thesis: Development of Obstacle Avoidance Algorithms in Niching Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithms for Multi-Target Search Multi-Robot System.

        How the system work:
        Robots is locate in a search area.
        Then the robots move to search for a targets.
        With Niching Particle Swarm Optimization, robots is sharing their best location related to possible target location, so robots can find the best possible target location.
        In this simulation, we used 40 robots, and 4 targets.

        The system is simulate in Webots Simulator using C language.
        I also use Matlab, just only use to learn about the Niching Particle Swarm Optimization because itâ€™s easy to write the code in Matlab and easy to visualize the result.

        Example application of this system is: search and rescue for disaster victims in a dangerous areas
